        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Doner kebab (UK: /ˈdɒnər kɪˈbæb/, US: /ˈdoʊnər kɪˈbɑːb/; Turkish: döner or döner kebap, pronounced [dœˈnæɾ
            ceˈbap]), also spelled as döner kebab, is a dish of Turkish origin made of meat cooked on a vertical
            rotisserie.Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next
            to a vertical cooking element. The operator uses a knife to slice thin shavings from the outer layer of the
            meat
            as it cooks. The vertical rotisserie was invented in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire, and dishes such as the
            Arab shawarma, Greek gyros, Canadian donair, and Mexican al pastor are derived from this.

            The modern sandwich variant of döner kebab originated and was popularized in 1970s West Berlin by Turkish
            immigrants.This was recognized by the Berlin-based Association of Turkish Doner Manufacturers in
            Europe in 2011.</p>
        <p>The sliced meat of a doner kebab may be served on a plate with various accompaniments, stuffed into a pita or
            other type of bread as a sandwich, or wrapped in a thin flatbread such as lavash or filo, known as a dürüm
            (literally meaning roll or wrap in Turkish). Kadir Nurman in the early 1970s introduced the sandwich or wrap
            form, which has become popular around the world as a fast food dish sold by kebab shops, and is often called
            simply a "kebab".[10] The sandwich generally contains salad or vegetables, which may include tomato,
            lettuce,
            cabbage, onion with sumac, fresh or pickled cucumber, or chili, and various types of sauces.</p>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip all the ingredients except the oil into a food processor with
                a
                large pinch of salt and lots of ground pepper. Pulse until everything is combined and chopped together.
                You
                can also just squish everything together in a bowl but this will give you a looser finish.</li>
            <li>Oil a large sheet of foil, tip the meat mix in the middle and mould to a very thick sausage, roughly the
                shape of an aubergine. Roll up the foil tightly, twisting up the ends to create a Christmas cracker
                shape.
            </li>
            <li>Lay on a shallow roasting tin and roast in the oven for 35-40 mins, turning occasionally, or until a
                digital
                cooking thermometer reads 75C when pierced in the middle. Leave the kebab to cool a little, then unwrap
                the
                foil. Place back on the tray and brown under the grill or with a blowtorch</li>
            <li>Place on a board and carve into thin slices. For full doner mode, you can hold the kebab up with a
                roasting
                fork or metal skewer and carve. Serve with warm pitta bread and any of the other accompaniments,
                including
                our chilli sauce and garlic yogurt sauce.</li>
        </ol>
