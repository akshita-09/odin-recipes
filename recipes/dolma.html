    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Dolma is one of the oldest national dishes of Azerbaijan.<br>

        The name of the dish, of Turkish origin, indicates the technique of its preparation - filling vegetable, grape,
        Rumex, hornbeam and quince leaves, or a thin dough layer, with various stuffings. In some regions it is called
        “sarma”.</p>
    <p>Dolma, in Middle Eastern and Greek cuisine, any of various stuffed vegetable dishes—notably, the young leaves of
        the grapevine stuffed with a lemon-flavoured mixture of rice, onion, and, frequently, ground lamb. Although
        dolmas are usually eaten cold as an appetizer, Greek dolmades with lamb are served hot as a main course with an
        avgolémono sauce of egg yolks and lemon juice. Other vegetables such as zucchini, green peppers, cabbage, and
        onions are similarly prepared.</p>
    <p>
        Even after being boiled and stored in oil for god knows how long, the grape leaves have a subtle but lingering
        wine-like taste that muddles into the dill and mint scrap up. Essentially, a dolma is a tiny flavor battlefield
        where different flavors keep coming out on top.</p>
